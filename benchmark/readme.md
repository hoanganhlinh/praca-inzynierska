# OTP Software Analysis

This folder represents the work done with the use of OTP software. This represents the analysis of schedule routes and real-time routes, their comparison, statistical testing, plotting on the map etc..  

Benchmark clean represents all and only the codes used for the document.  

Not every piece of analysis presented here has been shown in the final document, for one of the reasons:

- either it was not verbalizable enough to be placed there
- there were errors in the approach
- the plots did not show well enough the point that was being made
